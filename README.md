This is a LUT Game Development course project with Unity3D, a 2D game featuring physics based flying, transporting your mates, destroyable objects, health, damage and score systems. It is inspired by the 1994 game UGH! by Play Byte. The game is currently in a proof of concept state with many of the planned features and systems missing.
